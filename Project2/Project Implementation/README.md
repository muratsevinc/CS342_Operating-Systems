Multi-Threaded Scheduling Simulator

*Project Summary:*
This is a *simulator* application project that simulates the behaviors of various scheduling algorithms with threads.


*How to start the program:*

	- Run the Makefile
	- Start the produced application schedule by writing ./schedule <Thread Count> <Burst Count> <minB> <avgB> <minA> <avgA> <Algorithm Name>


*Used Methodoligies:*

	- CPU Scheduling & Synchronization
	- Threads
    - Condition Variables



*Project Report:*
There is a "Project Report.pdf" file which compares well-known scheduling algorithms such as First-come first serve (FCFS), Shotest job first (SJF) etc.
